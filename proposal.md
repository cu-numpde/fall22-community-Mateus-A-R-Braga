## Software: Clawpack

*Write a paragraph describing what the software does and who its
primary audience is.*

Clawpack stands for Conservation Laws Package. Clawpack is a collection of solvers for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, such as advection or acoustic type problems. Aimed at solving conservation laws, Clawpack naturally employs the finite volume method. The collection includes classic Clawpack: a general hyperbolic PDE solver (written in Fortran), AMRClaw: with adaptive mesh refinement (written in Fortran), GeoClaw: aimed at geophysical flow (written in Fortran), and PyClaw: a version of Clawpack written in Python. Applications sutiable for the suite of Clawpack solvers includes variable-coefficient advection, acoustics, Euler equations, and many more conservation problems. The primary audience varies depending on which solver is used from the collection. In general, Clawpack could be usedful to those who studying high speed flows because the package was designed to handle hyperbolic euqations. Specifically to Geoclaw, it is well suited for people interested in solving geophysics problems.

The key features of the software include: 
* Capability to solve general hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs)
** Riemann solvers for many common applications are bundled with the software (A Riemann solver needs to be provided to deal with discontinuities, shocks, at the faces between cells)
* AMRClaw and GeoClaw includes adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
* PyClaw allows for parallelism scalable to the tens of thousands of cores

Summary list of solvers included with Clawpack:
* Classic (single grid solvers in Fortran)
* AMRClaw Description and Detailed Contents (adaptive mesh refinement in Fortran)
* GeoClaw Description and Detailed Contents (geophysical flows with AMR, in Fortran)
* PyClaw (Python version of solvers)

### Install and run

Check the following boxes when complete or add a note below if you
encountered a problem.

### Notes/concerns/risks

Please comment on any anomalies or known risks to following this
project, if you were unable to answer any questions above, or
otherwise have concerns about the appropriateness of the software.  If
the project requires a contributor license agreement or other
procedural steps, please explain here.  "None at this time" is
acceptable for this question.

Notes:

* If using either the Fortran or Python installations there is an automated test suite that runs several tests and compares the solution (parts of the soltution) to archived resutls.

* Permissive license: Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license (BSD 3-Clause)
* Concern about license: On the Clawpack website the copyright is from 1994-2020, does that mean it is no longer in effect? => "Copyright (c) 1994â€“2020, The Clawpack Development Team. All rights reserved."

* Travis continuos integration is used
